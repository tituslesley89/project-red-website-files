            Our group is developing an emergency ventilator called the "Respiratory Emergency Device," or RED.  Why should you support our project over any of other ventilator projects out there?   One simple reason:  our team is the only non-profit design team founded and led by engineers with ventilator design experience.

            Project RED was founded in mid-March 2020 by two veteran  engineers who previously spent years developing a commercial ventilator.  The founders have 15-20 years experience in product development, spanning medical devices, aerospace equipment, consumer goods, scientific test equipment and many other areas of industry.    We've recruited over 10 additional volunteers across the US and Canada to help us.  Project RED is incorporated as a California non-profit, and our sole mission is to develop a low-cost, reliable, easy to manufacture and effective emergency ventilator for use in worldwide emergency scenarios.

            Ventilator design is a highly complicated and niche field involving many engineering disciplines, medical knowledge and an understanding of rules and regulations. While many of the ongoing fast-turn attempts to build an emergency device are truly admirable, it is likely that most will either never make it to volume production, or prove too hazardous and unreliable for practical use. Two of the RED founders, Edward Ayrapetian and Mohan Gurunathan, have over 5 years of previous design experience working on medical ventilators. As engineers with a solid understanding of medical ventilator design, they are uniquely positioned to develop a fast-track ventilator solution which can be rapidly scaled up to help meet the needs of the global population. On March 15, 2020, they formed a non-profit team of 6 people with the goal of developing and deploying a limited-feature ventilator which provides the most important features needed for treating the COVID-19 crisis. The teamâ€™s expertise spans across the disciplines of electrical, mechanical, software, and pneumatic engineering.
