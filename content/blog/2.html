<p>
    Our ventilator prototype has been up and breathing under software control for the past few days. We are working on
    tuning the control loops, testing different tidal volumes and patient conditions, and additional hardware/software
    integration tasks. In this video you can see several basic closed-loop pressure controlled breaths occurring. The
    control loop is not fully tuned yet, but we are still able to regulate the inspiratory pressure to around 40 cmH20
    (this is very high for a patient scenario, but that's the test case where we took the video :) ) We regulate the
    patient pressure by rapidly varying the speed of our air blower, which has a very fast dynamic response. So far
    things are looking really good!
