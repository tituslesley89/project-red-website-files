    Hello Project Red supporters, we are making awesome progress on our ventilator design so I wanted to share another
    update! Recently we demonstrated two critical features: active electronic control of PEEP and Air/O2 mixing. We are
    also making great progress on our UI design, with the help of our talented UI/UX design partner, <a
        href="https://www.ics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ICS (www.ics.com)</a>.
    Attached is a screen shot of the ventilation UI. It is clear and intuitive, and when paired with our 10.1", 1280x800
    IPS LCD screen, will be clearly visible from across the room. We think it will be one of the best ventilator UIs out
    there!
