    Hi Project RED supporters,
</p>

<p>
    After ~8 months of development, we have a demonstration of the RED-1 ventilator operating in its production chassis
    form! This is one of the 4 pre-production ventilators we have built, shown ventilating a model lung. Most
    importantly,
    this machine can be built for < $4000 USD, which makes it a game-changer in terms of ventilator affordability. Next,
        we'll be starting on a detailed debug, integration and verification phase so we can prove that the device is
        safe and effective, and can meet FDA EUA requirements. This will likely take at least a few months, but we'll
        keep you updated as we go along. We're still waiting to hear about our grant applications, so appreciate any
        generous <a href="/donate">donations</a> that you can offer! Thank you!
</p>
