Our ventilator design is based on a high-speed blower which is capable of providing the pressure and flow necessary to ventilate a patient's lungs. Attached video is from our testing in the first 2 weeks of the project, showing how the blower can inflate and maintain a target pressure within the lung.

With the help of our awesome Canadian mechanical engineers we developed this custom plastic manifold, used for combining air and oxygen in the proper fractions before delivering it to the patient.
