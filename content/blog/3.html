<p>
    OK we wanted to post another update showing a bit more about how our prototype ventilator is working.
</p>

<p>
    In this video, Edward shows how our ventilator is able to to track a pressure target curve by controlling the speed
    of our blower, and also hit a specific volume target (Vt=200mL) by adjusting the peak pressure on each breath. This
    algorithm is also called "PRVC" and is a widely accepted method of ventilating patients as their lung conditions
    change over time.
</p>

<p>
    In parallel, we are actively working on updates to the pneumatic, electronic, mechanical and industrial design of
    the unit. Thanks for your support!
