    Hello Project Red supporters, we have a concept drawing of what we are planning for our ventilator design. See
    attached image. The ventilator will have a vibrant, 10.1" color LCD touchscreen as the main interface. The display
    is tilted at a 70 degree angle to optimize visibility and touchscreen access. The inhale and exhale breathing ports
    are on the right side. The overall size is approximately 14 x 10 x 7 inches, about the size of a small briefcase,
    and it will be readily portable. We're confident we can fit our design into this form factor, and the mechanical
    engineering detail work is underway!
