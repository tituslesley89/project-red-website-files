Murat hails from the great land of Canada, but for nearly 15 years has been developing high quality embedded software in
Silicon Valley. Murat has written code for everything from medical devices to self-driving trucks to proximity-sensing
LED jackets. If it's got hardware, software, and something cool to put it all in, chances are he's into it.
