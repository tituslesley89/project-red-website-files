<a href="https://polyspectra.com/" target="_blank">Polyspectra</a> is an additive manufacturing startup in Berkeley,
California, which is bringing to market an advanced new
polymer discovered during PhD research at CalTech. The <a href="https://polyspectra.com/alpha/" target="_blank">Cor
    Alpha</a> polymer is the most rugged 3D printable material on the
market today, and can stand up to intense heat, pressure and impact forces. Polyspectra was kind enough to provide free
3D printed samples of critical parts needed for ventilator research and development.
