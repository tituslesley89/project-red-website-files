<a href="https://paailatechnology.com/" target="_blank">Paaila Technology</a> is a unique and innovative Robotics and AI
company founded in Kathmandu, Nepal. Paaila’s aim is to
create world-class, friendly and interactive humanoid robots that perform valuable services to businesses and consumers
alike. Paaila has created and deployed several service robots, including <a
    href="https://paailatechnology.com/robotics/waiter/" target="_blank">Ginger</a> (a waiter robot), <a
    href="https://paailatechnology.com/robotics/pari2/" target="_blank">Pari 2</a> (a business
assistant robot), and <a href="https://paailatechnology.com/robotics/pari/" target="_blank">Pari 1</a> (a chat-robot).
Their waiter robot is featured at the restaurant <a href="https://naulo.com.np/" target="_blank">NAULO</a>, Nepal’s
first fully
digitized robotic restaurant (and possibly the only one in East Asia). The company has won numerous awards, including
ICT Best Startup Award (2017), Most Innovative Product Award (2017), and Most Creative Business Nepal (2018). Paaila has
partnered with Project RED to develop low-cost ventilators specifically for the Nepal market, where the total number of
in-country ventilators numbers in the hundreds, for a population of 28 million.
